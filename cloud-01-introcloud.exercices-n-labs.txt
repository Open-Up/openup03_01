Exercices
==========

Try to build and deploy an application to Heroku.

	https://www.heroku.com

Heroku is a PaaS. It allows free accounts for experimentations and sandboxing.
It is better to stick with online resources since these courses will be given in 2017.
Until then, there could be changes. Following the official tutorials will prevent "broken lab instructions".

1. Create an account on Heroku.
2. Create a Git repository on Github for your project.
3. Follow one of the tutorials:

	- Java: 	https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-spring-mvc-hibernate
	- NodeJS: 	https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction
			You may have to create a Node application first.
			Or look at https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mean-apps-restful-api

Once an application is deploed, make a change in the application and push it to the Github account.
Verify it is redeployed by Heroku and that changes are applied.

Estimated duration: between 90 and 120 minutes.
